## What's New in v1.4

### Optimizer Engine (`packages/optimizer/`)
- **Price feed** — CoinGecko free tier, 5-minute cache, fallback values
- **Gas feed** — Polygon + Base public RPC polling, 2-minute cache
- **Yield scorer** — ranks all pending adapter claims by USD value; only flags ready when reward ≥ 5× gas cost
- **Device discovery** — reads phone capabilities (GPS, motion, camera, barometer) and surfaces DePIN networks you qualify for but aren't running yet
- **Shared PollingPool** — replaces individual `setInterval`s in each adapter; one loop serves all five networks (~30% battery reduction)
- **OptimizationReport modal** — weekly savings summary: gas avoided, battery hours saved, new networks discovered, verified-user premium earned

### Genesis Score (`packages/credits/`)
- **Public reputation score** for sovereign nodes — like a credit grade. **NOT a token, NOT transferable, NOT priced, NEVER redeemable.**
- Earns for: uptime, heartbeats, network connections, proof generation, optimizer use
- 2× accrual for Genesis nodes (minted before public launch); rate is locked permanently
- Backed up to Cloudflare KV; visible in-app via `GenesisCreditsTicker`
- Will be readable by partners (via the `verify-device` API) so they can offer better rates to high-grade operators — but the score itself never leaves the bureau

### Verified-User Premium
- `EarningEntry` schema extended with `standardRate`, `premiumRate`, `premiumBasisPoints`
- Receipts are premium-aware — show exactly how much extra a verified user earned vs standalone
- `DepinAdapter` interface now carries `AdapterRateMetadata` so each network can declare its rate structure

### Partner Verification Webhook
- `POST /api/verify-device` live at `getkinetik.app/api/verify-device`
- Ed25519 signature verified using Cloudflare Workers' native SubtleCrypto
- Returns: `valid`, `nodeId`, `nodeAge`, `heartbeatCount`, `sensorData`
- Full docs: `docs/api/verify-device.md`

### Documentation (`docs/`)
- `architecture.md` — four-layer system overview (L1–L4)
- `cryptography.md` — Ed25519 contract, stableStringify spec, hash chaining
- `adapter-contract.md` — guide for partner integrators
- `api/verify-device.md` — full webhook specification
- `IP-ASSIGNMENT.md` — legal IP assignment to OutFromNothing LLC

### Infrastructure
- `landing/metrics/` — public network metrics dashboard (`/api/metrics`)
- `functions/api/credits.js` — Genesis Credits KV backup endpoint
- GitHub Issue templates + PR template + SECURITY.md
